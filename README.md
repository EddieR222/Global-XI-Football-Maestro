## Welcome to Global XI Football Maestro!

Global XI Football Maestro is a work-in progress alternative football manager game with one principle in mind:

> FOOTBALL IS FOR EVERYONE
> 

Football should be enjoyed by everyone regardless of background, financial status, or location. For this reason, Global XI Football Maestro is going to be a **Free** and **Open Source** football game that aims to start a community of players all working together to make the best version a football game can be.

This project aims to be more than a game; it's the start of a movement. As a FOSS football game, I hope this game inspires people of all different talents to work together to make the beautiful game as fun and personal to everyone. If you wish to help this dream become a reality, please consider contributing to this project!

# **Goals**

---

## **Free to Play**

### Free to all players

This game will be free to all players. This was done to hopefully ensure that all players can access the game regardless of their financial standing. Free means that anyone in the world can download the game and play it. This also translates to the future too as this game will remain FREE FOREVER

### No Yearly Releases

In addition to the game being free forever, the game will also not have yearly releases. This means that this game is not planned to have a new version every year. Instead, the game will receive FREE UPDATES and FREE DLC to ensure the game continues to get better. 

Even if there is a need to release a Global XI Football Maestro 2, perhaps due to change of game engine or entire rework, the new game will also be free. Yes, ALL FUTURE INSTALLMENTS WILL ALSO BE FREE. This ensures that at no point will this game charge users to begin playing 

### No ADs

There will also be no Ads in the game as well. This is true for mobile, pc, and website. This is mostly due to my own hatred of Ads but also because not charging money to play but then spamming ads every minute feels disingenuous. Therefore, all installments of this game will include NO ADS 

### No In-Game Purchases

There will be no form of in-game purchases. This follows the same principle as making the game free but also ensuring there is absolutely NO PAYWALL to any player. This also means any added content in the form of DLC will also be free. This also means there will be NO PAY-TO-WIN in the game at all. (especially true even when multiplayer is introduced). This game is meant to be fair to all players so no player will gain an advantage based on how much money they have to spare. 

> Money will never be the priority, the beautiful game comes first! - Global XI Football Maestro
> 

## **Open Source**

### Openly Available Source Code

The game’s entire source code will be publicly available. This ensures that everyone will know what they are installing. This also helps to foster more positive things that will be discussed on more later. 

### Collaboration and Contribution

By being open source, this allows everyone to help contribute to this game. If you love football, you are more than welcome to help contribute to this game. You don't even need to be able to code. Any music, art, football kits, stadium designing, world building, or even data collection is encouraged. The aim is for everyone who loves football to help contribute to make this game the best it can be. In essence, anyone who makes a contribution helps make the game BETTER FOR EVERYONE. To learn how to contribute, please read over our Contributing Guidelines

### Learning and Education

Open Source means that anyone can take this time to LEARN more about Godot, coding, art, and Game Development as a whole. Even once the game is released, the game can still be a useful resource for other aspiring game designers to offshoot off this game and create their own football manager game. 

### Longevity

Being Open Source also ensures that the game has more longevity outside of a gaming company. Company based games rely on that company to stay afloat which often translates to paywalls, in-game purchases, and subscription models. Since anyone and everyone can help make this game, this game doesn’t rely on one company to survive. As long as a small number of people, even one person, continues to work on this game - then this game can LIVE FOREVER

## **Fully Customizable**

### In-Game Customization

Unfortunately, the players and teams in the game will have to be fake due to licensing. But, this allows a GREATER RANGE OF FREEDOM. You, the player, will be allowed to edit and change anything about the footballing world. You can edit the territories, confederations, tournaments, teams, players, kits, stadiums, and even the managers. I aim to make everything in this game as editable from inside the game as possible. 

For example, you can…..

1. Create a club with a custom logo, name, stats, players, manager, and even kits
2. Have Multiple Kits Per Team, allowing you to change kits yearly
3. Add a League Pyramid to a country that doesn’t have one in real life
4. Create Custom Tournaments in any country, confederation, and even across the world
5. Create custom territories like adding the Roman Empire, Mongolian Empire, or even past countries like Yugoslavia or USSR

and so much more….

The World of Football is truly up to you to customize and play around with

### Shareable Databases

While the In-Game editors will focus on changing small details (or even starting from scratch), it still would be a tedious task to create an entire new world in game. For that reason, there will be an in-game feature that can load in all the territories, confederations, teams, player, etc with the use of CSV files saved on your own computer. This allows players to create in-game databases that they can share with the world. This means you can write everything inside a csv file (such as Google Sheets) and, with a few clicks of a button, load an entire database into the game. Some examples of this includes

1. Downloading CSV Databases from other players
2. Sharing a Google Sheets with your friends to create your own custom world
3. A big content creator creating a Database in collaboration with their followers

### Mod Friendly

The only issue with Mods for creating a custom experience is that often two mods don’t work with each other. In other words, everyone creating their own ideas leads to a lot of mods incompatible with other mods. To avoid this, open source allows for all additions to be enjoyed by everyone. However, if an idea doesn’t align with the vision of the game (ex. Database focusing on only football in England and no other country) then mods are a great way to get that custom experience and share it with the world. For that reason, and the fact that the game is open source, the game will attempt to be as mod friendly as can be

Of course, there will be double or even triple national players, especially with dependencies. If I have missed any territory please let me know 🙂

### More League Depth

Not only will every territory have a domestic league (if they have one in real life) but they will go as deep into the league pyramid as I can find. And with the help of individuals across the globe, these league pyramids can be made even deeper. Of course, the teams will be fake but follow the real life leagues as closely as can be

## **Single Player**

This game, upon first release, is planned to be a single player experience. There are plans for future updates to allow for 1v1 multiplayer but the first release will fully focus on single player experience. My hope is that one day there can be multiplayer manager modes where each player controls one team or 11 v 11 multiplayer football matches. This is still to be decided but please expect the first release to be single player only for now.

## **New Game Modes**

### **Football Federation President**

Here the player will be in charge of not only the national team of a country but also the entire league pyramid of a territory. Make your national team the best in the world and attempt to become the best league pyramid in the world. You must allocate funds and make changes to the leagues to help all teams in the league pyramid become better.

### **Confederation President**

Play as the president of an entire confederation. Here you will be in control of several territories league systems. You can improve confederation wide tournaments, increase profit to better provide the leagues with money, and help the entire confederation become the best in the world. For example, you can make the CAF confederation the best and improve football in all of Africa. Maybe choose the OFC and make Oceania the most powerful footballing confederation. This mode is for people who wish to make multiple territories improve in football and also change the dynamics of the footballing world.

More game modes to be announced....

# **Technologies**

The game will be written in **Godot 4.2** (as of now) and using the **GDScript** language (for now). The game will be released on PC and Mobile upon initial release. Release date is still to be decided but it can be made earlier the more people help to contribute!!

If you wish to see this game come to reality faster, please help contribute to this game! **Thank you!**

# Current State

For the past three months, I have been the sole developer of the game. While I am proud of where I am, progress can be much faster. For the most part, the main focus has been on the customization of the game so far. Unit Testing is an important step moving forward and is documentation of everything. To contribute, please feel free to pull and create a new branch. Since development is still early, a lot of new features or changes can be agreed upon. If a feature makes the game more accessible and fun, it is a great feature to include. Documentation and more details will be provided soon. For now, I hope this may seem as a worthy project for anyone and everyone to help out :)
