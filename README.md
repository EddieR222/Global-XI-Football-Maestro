# Introduction

Welcome to Global XI Football Maestro, a work in progress alternative football game with one principle in mind: Football Is For Everyone. Football should be enjoyed by everyone regardless of background, financial status, or location. For this reason, Global XI Football Maestro is going to be a **Free** and **Open Source** football game that aims to start a community of players all working together to make the best version a football game can be.

This project aims to be more than a game; it's the start of a movement. As a FOSS football game, I hope this game inspires people of all different talents to work together to make the beautiful game as fun and personal to everyone. If you wish to help this dream become a reality, please consider contributing to this project!


# Features
While there are a lot of goals to be reached for this project, there are 5 big goals for the first planned release

## Goals

1. **Free to Play**

This game will be free to start playing. This hopefully ensures all players can access this game regardless of money. This also applies to the future as any future games in this series will also be free. Of course, there will also be NO ADS allowed in the game. But most importantly, there will be no PAY TO WIN microtransactions. Money will never be the priority, the beautiful game comes first!

2. **Open Source**

By being open source, this allows everyone to help contribute to this game. If you love football, you are more than welcome to help contribute to this game. You don't even need to be able to code. Any music, art, football kits, stadium designing, world building, or even data collection is encouraged. The aim is for everyone who loves football to help contribute to make this game the best it can be. In essence, this game will be made by the people for the people. If you don't like the direction this game is heading then anyone can make their own forks of the game code and build upon it. 

Even if this game isn't the best one in a couple years, I hope by making this game open source I can inspire a community of creators who help create free amazing football games for **everyone**.

3. **Fully Customizable**

Unfortunately, the players and teams in the game will have to be fake due to licensing. But, this allows a greater range of freedom. You, the player, will be allowed to edit and change anything about the footballing world. You can edit the territories, confederations, tournaments, teams, players, kits, stadiums, and even the managers. I aim to make everything in this game as editable from inside the game as possible. Anything beyond that can also be changed from the code itself. I will also attempt to make this game as mod friendly as possible too in hopes everyone can create their ideal footballing world and share it with everyone.

4. **World Inclusive**

This game aims to feature at least the top flight league from every territory on earth (if they have one of course). There will also be league pyramids for countries that have them. For example, there is a league depth of 6 for the English Territory. These league depths can of course be expanded upon by the user if desired. My hope is that by including all territories around the world, everyone can feel represented in this game. I also wish to showcase and explore the passion and beauty of football from all corners of the world. 

5. **Single Player**

This game, upon first release, is planned to be a single player player experience. There are plans for future updates to allow for 1v1 multiplayer but the first release will fully focus on single player experience. My hope is that one day there can be multiplayer manager modes where each player controls one team or 11 v 11 multiplayer football matches. This is still to be decided but please expect the first release to be single player only for now.


## New Game Modes

### Football Federation President
Here the player will be in charge of not only the national team of a country but also the entire league pyramid of a territory. Make your national team the best in the world and attempt to become the best league pyramid in the world. You must allocate funds and make changes to the leagues to help all teams in the league pyramid become better.  

### Confederation President
Play as the president of an entire confederation. Here you will be in control of several territories league systems. You can improve confederation wide tournaments, increase profit to better provide the leagues with money, and help the entire confederation become the best in the world. For example, you can make the CAF confederation the best and improve football in all of Africa. Maybe choose the OFC and make Oceania the most powerful footballing confederation. This mode is for people who wish to make multiple territories improve in football and also change the dynamics of the footballing world. 

More game modes to be announced....

# Technologies

The game will be written in **Godot 4.2** (as of now) and using the **GDScript** language (for now). The game will be released on PC and Mobile upon initial release. Release date is still to be decided but it can be made earlier the more people help to contribute!!

If you wish to see this game come to reality faster, please help contribute to this game! **Thank you!**

# Current State

For the past three months, I have been the sole developer of the game. While I am proud of where I am, progress can be much faster. For the most part, the main focus has been on the customization of the game so far. Unit Testing is an important step moving forward and is documentation of everything. To contribute, please feel free to pull and create a new branch. Since development is still early, a lot of new features or changes can be agreed upon. If a feature makes the game more accessible and fun, it is a great feature to include. Documentation and more details will be provided soon. For now, I hope this may seem as a worthy project for anyone and everyone to help out :)  

# Rules
