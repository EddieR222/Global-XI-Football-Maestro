# Introduction

### Welcome to Global XI Football Maestro 

Thank you for considering contributing to Global XI Football Maestro. Any contributions help and every contribution is greatly appreciated :)

### Make Sure to Read these Guidelines

In order to keep the construction of this game as smooth as possible, it is important to follow these guidelines laid out here. To both respect all other contributors and to ensure the game gets done as quickly and smoothly as possible please read till the end of these guidelines to ensure your contributions are helpful :)

### Contributions We Need!

This game being open source means that we want ANYONE to be able to contribute. This can come in many forms. Since this game is still early in development almost all aspects of game development need some help. Here are some ideas of how to contribute
1. Help with the Code
2. Improve Documentation
3. Report Bugs
4. Feature Requests
5. Promotion
6. Creating game assets such as music, visuals, and even selecting nice color palettes

The way you contribute is up to you :)


# Ground Rules
### Rules

In order for this community to remain fun and productive, please abide by the rules which can be found in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file in the repo.

> Main Responsibilities
> * The main platforms being supported are mobile and PC/MAC/Linux. Please DO NOT add features in Godot that restrict any of the before mentioned platforms
> * Ensure that code is tested 
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. 

# Your First Contribution
Before you make your first contribution, ensure to find the easiest ways to contribute first. Issues should be label as the following

Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. Perfect for first contributions <br />
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. <br />
Critical issues - issues that may be complex and/or must be resolved as soon as possible <br />


Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).



At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### How to submit a contribution
How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:


* To test code, please install the GUT addon in the godot asset library


For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request



>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug

### How to file a bug report.


When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Godot are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### Discord

Discord is the best place to suggest new features and ideas. The link to join is in the homepage of the repo
The best way to suggest a feature is to answer the following question as well

> How does this benefit everyone playing the Game?


# Code review process
### How a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
The founder of this Game or Selected Moderator will need to accept the contribution first before it can be submitted. The hope is that at least once a week the moderators will go through the pull requests. 
If feedback is given and there is no new developments to the PR after a month, the pull request may be closed due to inactivity

# Community
### Discord 

Please use the official discord for connecting to the rest of the community and to get a better sense of how the game is going. This discord also serves other functions such as brainstorming, troubleshooting, football discussions, and questions. 
The link to join should be in the homepage of the repo. 

### Email

If not able to use Discord, emailing the founder is also possible by emailing globalxifootballmaestro@gmail.com. Please send important messages here :)

### Future
The hope is if the community gets big enough a website and reddit page may be made so more discussion about the game can be made. For now please be patient and follow the rules above! Thank you :)
